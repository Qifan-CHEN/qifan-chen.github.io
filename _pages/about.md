Hello, I am Chen Qifan, a fifth-year PhD candidate at The Ohio State University specializing in computational mathematics. I am advised by Prof. [Yulong Xing](https://people.math.osu.edu/xing.205/). I received my B.S. in Mathematics (First Class Honours) from The Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2021, where my final year project was supervised by Prof. [Jun Zou](https://www.math.cuhk.edu.hk/people/academic-staff/zou). 


My research interests lie in Numerical Analysis, Scientific Computing, and AI for Science. My thesis involves developing temporal discretizations for hyperbolic conservation laws. I also develop data-driven modeling of systems governed by unknown equations advised by Prof. [Dongbin Xiu](https://sites.google.com/view/dongbin-xiu). I welcome discussions and potential collaborations.

I'm co-organizing the [Student Computational Math Seminar](https://u.osu.edu/studentcomputationalmathseminar/) at OSU. Feel free to contact me if you want to give a talk.

In my free time, I enjoy badminton, playing the Chinese flute, video games, and supporting Chengdu Rongcheng FC.
